Gamification in general is a fairly new field of study, especially when it comes to the combination of gamification and education, even more so in non-academic contexts. Individual learning has become accessible to the masses over the recent years due to the development and accessibility of smartphones, their presence permeating every aspect of life, presenting a powerful tool to acquire new knowledge and skills on a private, individual level.

Despite the massive increase in studies in the recent years that try to cover this topic, there is very little consensus on which gaming techniques and elements are seen as effective and universally applicable to gamification tools in general, even less so in learning. This paper compiles the current state of the art of research in this field, especially focussing on the overlap of efficient instructional design and gamification techniques and finally curate a comprehensive list of which gamification elements can universally be implemented in the development of a gamified learning application for private use.

This paper is a compilation looking at a general consensus on which gamification elements are considered effective for the development of a gamified application specifically for skill and knowledge acquisition. Keywords like Gamification, Game-Based Learning and Educational Games are compared and differentiated, the benefits of Gamified learning clarified and how the current state of gamification in education is. Furthermore, general design elements in games and elements of learning that can be translated into gamification are analysed, as well as motivators like intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and general reward systems. Finally a list is compiled of the gamification elements considered most effective for this purpose alongside with a few questions that can be asked during the development process of such an application.\\

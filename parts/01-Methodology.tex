Despite the research on the efficacy of gamification not being inexistent, not all authors will focus on evaluating the same elements and the outcome of the same techniques. To best create a compilation of relevant knowledge, this paper focuses on the analysis of Gamification, Game-Based Learning, Educational Games, and different Reward Systems.

Even focusing on the most common themes and keywords, not all of the papers in this compilation will touch every aspect of gamification. To keep this work consistent, a result was only included if it was present in two or more papers; that was considered the bare minimum to analyse the consensus and to explore where authors diverge on their observations.

Given how relatively new the topic of gamification in personal learning contexts is, this compilation also includes results of studies in adjacent topics, like Game-based learning, games in education in general, as well as formal academic education. Although these are not the precise areas that this paper is proposing to analyse, they are close enough and were necessary to create a significant sample of the state of the art. It is expected that with more time and development in the field, more research will be done in the specific area of gamification for individual, independent learning.
